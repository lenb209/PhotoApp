# Contest Feature Management

The contest functionality has been temporarily disabled but all code remains intact for easy reactivation.

## 🔧 How to Reactivate Contests

### Method 1: CSS Variable (Recommended)
1. Open `frontend/styles.css`
2. Find the Feature Flags section (around line 18)
3. Change `--contests-enabled: none;` to `--contests-enabled: block;`
4. Save the file - contests will be immediately visible again!

### Method 2: Remove Contest Classes
Alternatively, you can remove all `contest-feature` classes from the HTML files:
- `index.html`
- `user-dashboard.html`
- `events.html` 
- `club.html`
- `contests.html`

## 📂 Contest Files (Preserved)
All contest functionality is intact:
- `contests.html` - Main contests page
- `contests.css` - Contest styling
- `contests.js` - Contest functionality
- Contest creation modals and forms
- Backend API endpoints (if implemented)

## 🎯 Current Status
- ❌ Contest navigation links are hidden
- ❌ Contest footer links are hidden  
- ✅ Contest pages still accessible via direct URL
- ✅ All contest code preserved
- ✅ Easy one-line reactivation

## 🚀 Quick Reactivation
```css
/* In styles.css - Change this line: */
--contests-enabled: none; /* DISABLED */

/* To this: */
--contests-enabled: block; /* ENABLED */
```

That's it! Contests will be fully functional again.
